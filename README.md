# FreeChartedWater-Server
I'm a big fan of the Koei's [Uncharted Waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_Waters) series. but as you know, recent series (UW5, UW6) are sucks!


so, I decided to make my own Uncharted Water game, so this is the reason why the name of project is 'FreeChartedWater'.
